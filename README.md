# Google-Books-Search
### A React-based Google Books Search app
Heroku deployment: https://anz-google-books.herokuapp.com/


In this activity, I was to create a new React-based Google Books Search app. This assignment required me to create React components, work with helper/util functions, and utilize React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. I also used Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later.

## Devlopment Notes

I somewhat ran out of time to do this cleanly, but my purpose for this exercise was 3 part:
* stand up a functional react app in ~1-day solo
* use functional components
* practice passing props between parents and children

So, while it is still quite rough aroun the edges, I feel accomplished in my learning goals and am glad I did the exercise.
